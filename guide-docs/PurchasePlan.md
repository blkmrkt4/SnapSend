# Purchase Plan

## Model

One-time purchase. No subscription. One license key per purchase, shared across all devices in the tier.

## Tiers

| Tier | Devices | Price | Activation Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal | 3 | $19 | 3 |
| Team | 10 | $39 | 10 |
| Business | 25 | $79 | 25 |

## Lemon Squeezy Configuration

- Single product with three variants (Personal, Team, Business)
- License keys enabled on all variants
- License length: perpetual (no expiration)
- Activation limit: set per variant as shown above
- One key per purchase — buyer installs on their machines and shares the key with others on their network

## One-Liner

**Send files between any devices on your network. No cloud, no cables, no hassle.**

## Positioning Notes

- Competing against LocalSend (free, open-source) on experience, not on price
- The value is in polish: clipboard sync, screenshot capture/crop, drag-and-drop file explorer, zero-config discovery
- 3-seat minimum avoids the dead-on-arrival problem of selling a single seat for a product that requires two devices to function
- Team tier priced close to Personal to encourage upsell — $20 more for 7 extra seats is obvious value
